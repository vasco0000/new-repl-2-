                <p>Good Morning my sleepyhead, I hope you had a great sleep last night,</p>
                <p>I really want to clear something that I feel comes mostly from misunderstandings from both sides, I know sometime what i say or ask you to do/not do might sound controlling or you might get the wrong idea of me using a wrong tone because all of it happens on text and we don't really see our actual expressions or feel the actual tone or intention, it seems to me that whatever i say sounds in a tone that i might not be saying in but you imagine me saying that way and i'm not putting this on you because it has with the way i say it + texting can be like that, so although i know it will definitely be tougher for both of us but it will still be better to talk on a call and prevent any further misunderstanding, I don't want to do anything only my way and i don't want to tell you what to do with every single thing you do nor do i like doing that, and i want to know your perspective, I am ready to go through all of it with you even if we have to go through very difficult things, I am flexible to change if it's for the better of us so that we can meet in a meeting point where both of us are satisfied with the outcome, I love you to the moon and back my heart, you are my happiness my baby.</p>
                <p>shall we hop on a call tomorrow when you get back from office if you went if not around whenever you woke up and were free?</p>
